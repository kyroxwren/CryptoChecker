        # We could try to use an elaborate set of IF-statements (I dare you to try this), but a much easier
        # way is to simply add previousPrice and currentPrice to the list and then sort the list.
        #
        # However, we cannot simply use levelsList for this purpose, because it only stores values, while we
        # also want to print labeling text with these values - such as 'Price Level', 'Current Price' and
        # 'Previous Price'.

        # This new list must consist of sub-lists. Each sub-List will contain two items.
        # The first item will be the display-data we want to print - consisting of the labeling text and the price.
        # The second item consists of the price only.
        # We will use the second item to sort the list - since it makes no sense to sort the list based on
        # the label (the first item).
